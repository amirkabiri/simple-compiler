# Introduction
This a simple compiler about 100 lines of code that parses mathematical expressions and calculates the result of that.
I was studying for the "compiler design and principles" exam and I was bored from reading algorithms of this topic. so I decided to write a tiny compiler without using any complicated algorithm.
here you are, you can use this repository as you want.

# How to run?
just cone this and open index.html file, then open javascript console in browser and user calculator function like this:
```calculator('2 + 5 *  (2 + 0)')```

# Environment
you can run this project easily on the browser, it also can run on node.js, but need a few changes. for example, you must export functions inside of scanner.js, parser.js, solver.js.
then import those in a new js file and do like what I have done in index.html
